# Kid Conversation Simulator


# Description 
This project aims to simulate a dialogue between an adult and a young child. Children are naturally curious and often persistently inquire about the world around them. Frequently, adult's initial answers fail to fully satisfy a kid's curiosity, leading them to follow up with the ubiquitous question, "Why?" In some cases, adults resort to the succinct response of "just because" to encourage children to move on.

The simulator will employ a while loop to maintain the conversation, utilize a data structure (such as a list) to store questions , and leverage the random module to provide varied and engaging questions. By mimicking the dynamics of a real conversation, the project seeks to capture the essence of a childâ€™s insatiable curiosity.
